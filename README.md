# data_visualization
This repository contains projects that demonstrate my data visualization skills, specifically using **ggplot2** in R, **Adobe Illustrator**, and **RShiny**. I also have advanced data visualization skills in **Tableau**. See the dashboards at https://www.auditor.utah.gov/kids for examples of my work in Tableau. I specifically created the Teacher Pay, Graduation Rates, and Title I Program Effectiveness dashboards, and have updated and maintained the other dashboards on that site. 

Each folder in this repository contains the data, R code to create the visualization, and the final visualization, after exporting from R and refining in Adobe Illustrator. The projects in each folder are described below.

**conference_poster**

The poster for this project was created for a student research conference. The analysis results are based on work done in a research assistant position. Each of the visualizations are generated using ggplot2 in R. Then each visualization was refined in Adobe Illustrator. Finally, all visualizations were added to the poster for the conference. 

**eathquake_map**

This map shows both the location and magnitude of earthquakes around the world from September 26th through October 23rd, 2018. The maps are generated using ggplot2 in R, then refined in Adobe Illustrator. This visualization was created for a data visualization class.

**gapminder_map**

The purpose of this project was to recreate a high quality visualization from Gapminder: https://www.gapminder.org/tools. This folder contains code to create both a static and interactive version of Gapminder's income versus health scatterplot. The static visualization is generated using ggplot2 in R, then refined in Adobe Illustrator. The interactive version is generated using RShiny and the final product can be accessed here: https://kayleehodgson.shinyapps.io/WorldDevelopmentTrends. These visualizations were created for a data visualization class.

**regression_discontinuity**

This visualization displays the results of a regression discontinuity analysis of election outcomes. The visualization is generated using ggplot2 in R, then refined in Adobe Illustrator. This visualization was created for a data visualization class.
